Wiring up the board is a bit challenging.

The board has a grey data cable and a black power cable.  The data
cable has three signals: red, blue, and green.  All other wires should
be tied to GND.

Connect the header with the three signals to the micro controller
board on PORTB.  The green wire should be right next to the cutout,
towards the edge of the board.  Red and blue face inward, towards the
controller chip.

The power cable has three wires:

- yellow/green for GND
- blue for +5V
- brown for +8V (or +9V if you can stand the heat)

The lab power supply has a resistance change detector.  Disable it in
the “Setup” screen by switching “RRCd” from “YES” to “NO”.
